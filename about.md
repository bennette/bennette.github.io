###Academic
I am a Ph.D student in Industrial Engineering at Iowa State University.  My expected graduation date is May 2014.  My research focuses on the application of operations research techniques to data mining challenges.  In addition to operations research and data mining, I hold an interest in the meaningful visualization of data.

###Personal
I enjoy:
    - Family

    - Playing pool
    - Star Trek
    - Outdoors (hiking, skiing, fishing...)
