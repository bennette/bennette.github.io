</div>

The Army Reserve can be thought of as a strategic reserve.


Problem Statement
=========================

Question:  How is the size of the Army Reserve decided?  
<br>
Answer:  ????  

Problem Statement
==========================

We can use the newsvendor problem to help aide in this decision. 

Background and Justification
==========================

Army Reserve:

- Began in 1908 
- 205,000 strong (compare to 541,000 in the Army) 
- 38 days a year  
- Can be called to active duty

Background and Justification
============================

Newsvendor:  

- Products lose value after time
- Only one opportunity to place an order  
- Distribution of demand  
- Holding cost  
- Shortage cost 

Background and Justification
============================

**Newsvendor meets Army Reserve**

Products lose value after time:  
- Soldiers have a limitied shelf life.  
- How many 90 year old soldiers do you know?    

Background and Justification
============================
transition: none
**Newsvendor meets Army Reserve**  

Only one opportunity to place an order:  
- This is a simplifying assumption.  
- How many would sign up during war?

Background and Justification
============================

**Newsvendor meets Army Reserve**

Distribution of demand:  


Background and Justification
==========================

Army Reserve:  

- Soldiers have limited shelf life  
- Assume only one order is placed  
- Use historial data to model demand  
- Know holding cost  
- Unknown shortage cost
